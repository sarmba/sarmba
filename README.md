# @sarmba

I am a master's student at Northeastern University, studying Bioinformatics and concentrating in Data Analytics. This git account is for my personal work and my assignments from Northeastern.

## Coding

The majority of my code is done in python or R, with the rest in bash/shell scripts for linux. I am looking to branch into new languages, and willing to collaborate on projects for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.

## Private Repositories

Access to my private repositories is by request only. Northeastern does not allow public repositories for class-related work. Please reach out to me by email at baker.sar@northeastern.edu for more information.
